            <p> Hi! My name is Tsamara and I am a Commerce and Information Technology student from Indonesia. 
                I enjoy spending my time in front of my laptop and scouting for the best hot chocolate around Brisbane 
                (Noosa Chocolate’s hazelnut dark chocolate is on the top of the podium now). I have an interest in 
                exploring Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator since the beginning of 2019 and want to learn more.

                    <p> GUILT is a quiz that determines the user’s similarities with British convicts that are 
                        recorded in the SLQ data. To achieve this, the users will be taken through multiple scenarios 
                        where they have to choose between the options given. These options will eventually lead them 
                        to the British convict that matches them. These options are presented through interactive visuals 
                        where the users are presented with information on the British convicts, the event that lead to
                        their convictions and the result of it.

                    <p> 
                        My role in the project was a designer and coder. I designed the functionality and interactivity 
                        of the application. To deliver this, I utlise Adobe Illustrator to create the wireframe and eventually 
                        implementing it through CSS, JavaScript.

                <h3> What I have improved on: </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Explore tools on Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. </li>
                    <li> Using inVision and creating a digital prototype. </li>

                <h3> Reflection </h3>
                <p> The early protype is a new experience for me of in the process of ideating and 
                    creating a mobile application for age range outside my age. I find myself 
                    strunggling during the process of exploring the interactivity of my application. 
                    I can do better on my pitch such as; mentioning the target audience and their
                    interest on the application, my skills to create a concise and informational pitch
                    and maximizing my body language and eye contact to engage with the audiences.

                    <h3> Ideation </h3>

                    <figure class="ep-figure"> 
                        <image class="ep-ideation" src="image/ep-ideation.png"> </image>
                    </figure>

                    <p> I came up with the idea by combining the ideas discussed in the first
                        and second contact session. In the beginning, I had an idea of filtering
                        through the Overseas Travel data through a game. At first, I started with 
                        just informing the users with the Overseas Travel data. Through SCAMPER 
                        ideation method, I combine the data with a game method. Furthermore, 
                        I adapt the prototype to become a travel information application 
                        through game in the hope that it is more engaging to the users. 
                    
                    </p>

                    <h3> Design Choices </h3>

                    <figure class="ep-imagecont"> 
                        <image src="image/ep-1.jpg" alt="first page"> </image>
                        <image src="image/ep-2.jpg" alt="information page"> </image>
                        <image src="image/ep-3.jpg" alt="world-map"></image>
                    </figure>

                    <p> Overall, I chose a range of green as the color of the application. 
                        Since the application is directed to be used on a mobile phone, I 
                        adapted my designs to the common mobile phone dimension. I decided 
                        to go with a very simple design by not presenting a lot of information
                        on one page. The first image on the right is the character page 
                        and only shows the headshot of the character,their name and their 
                        position. Same goes with the second image that only presents the users 
                        with 2 clues to help their mission. The last image is the main interaction
                        of the application showing the world map across three pages. My main 
                        challenge when designing these pages were dividng the world map equally
                        and aligning them through 3 pages. 
                    </p>

                    <h3> Navigation  </h3> 

                    <figure class="ep-imagecont"> 
                        <image src="image/ep-4.jpg" alt="home button"></image>
                        <image src="image/ep-5.jpg" alt="side bar "></image>
                        <image src="image/ep-6.jpg" alt="navigation button in world map"></image>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        With the mobile-phone design in mind, I created buttons and navigations
                        throughout the application that is distinct and simple. The first image 
                        on the left highlighted the tick button on top left and the choose button 
                        in the bottom of the page. The tick button will then show the sidebar 
                        navigation that is shown by the image in the middle. The choose button 
                        guides the users to the next page. I decided to have a universal tick 
                        button throughout so that the user can go back to previous pages and see
                        the information they have got. The side bar navigation shows where
                        the users are at the moment and what else do they have to accomplish. 
                        The image on the left highlights the country pop-up and the next button. 
                        The country pop-up is a subtle way of delivering the information and 
                        it stands out on the world map. While the next and previous button 
                        are presented throughout the application so that it is easier 
                        for the users to roam around.

                    <h3> Ideation Process </h3> 

                    <p> We knew from the beginning that we wanted to expand on Nichola's idea of 
                        creating a quiz from British convict transport's data. During the ideation 
                        process I suggested a modern feel design to the team. I think this is a great 
                        idea to engage the users because modern designs tend to centralize the information. 
                        Apart from that, it provides a juxtaposition as it is an old data presented
                        in a modern way and thus shifts the user's focus on the information. 
                    </p>

                    <section class="wireframe">
                        <h3> Wireframes </h3>
                        <figure class="back-cont"> 
                            <image src="image/wip-2.jpg" alt="Interaction page 1 wireframe for WIP"></image>
                        </figure>
                        <p> The initial concept of GUILT is that user could explore around the interactive
                            pages in the first point of view. I initially designed the first interaction with
                            a hover ability as shown above. Designing the wireframe was a challenge for me as 
                            I have never done a landscape design before. I watched a couple videos on YouTube 
                            on how to do a landscape illustration on Adobe Illustration. These videos helped me 
                            a lot in making sure to emphasizes on the objects that I want the user to see. 
                            However, taking into account that the page is expected to be used on a mobile application 
                            lead us to getting into a 3D concpet for the application. Eventually, we change the 
                            interface of the interactionand the concept due to inputs from other students and the tutors. 
                        </p>

                        </figure>

                        <p> We knew from the beginning that we wanted to have a page in the end of every
                            interaction for the users to choose their options from. A main reason for this
                            is to encourage the users to explore around the interaction pages first and then 
                            make their decisions. The set up of the options page is chosen this way to highlights
                            the task that the user needs to get that. It centralize the options and focuses 
                            the users attention to the options. Later on, we found that this concept is the easiest
                            way to compile all of the user's data under the username.

                    <h3> Demo </h3>

                    <p> For the demo, I created some background designs that are higher quality and more 
                        colorful than the wireframes. To achieve this, I learned a couple tricks of layering 
                        on Adobe Illustration. Layering helps tie up the designs with background color or 
                        and thus helps emphasize the objects. 
                    </p>

                    <figure class="back-cont"> 
                        <image src="/image/demo-1.png"> </image>
                    </figure>

                    <p> During the demo itself, I was incharge with the design part of the pitch explaining 
                        that the design concept of the application and what I have done so far. In regards
                        of the design, I raised the question if the 3D design would make the application more 
                        attractive and engaging for the users. Based on the feedback received from other teams
                        and the tutor, the 3D will make it engaging and attractive. However, a lot of them 
                        are concern that it would be difficutl to implement and would not change much 
                        of the interaction. 

                        <br> 

                        Reflecting back on my individual pitch, I prepare more for this pitch. As the pitch is 
                        delivered as a group, I have to be cautious of the time and what my groupmates said. 
                        I prepare by practicing the pitch on my own and with my group before the class. Apart 
                        from that, I improve my pitch my using body language and eye contact more. 
                    </p>

                    <h3> Reflection </h3>

                    <p>  Work-in-Progress helps the group to finalize the ideation process and have a 
                        clearer idea of what we are trying to achieve. Through the report, user testing, 
                        demo and pitch I have improve my skills and have progress with my SMART goals. 
                        The group is also doing well as we have the backbone of the application and what
                        needed to be done are the designs and interactivity. My main concern going forward
                        is the uniformity and the collaboration of the group. We talk frequently about the 
                        things that needed to get done but sometimes we underestimate the time it takes 
                        to finish the work. 
                    </p>

                    <h3> Concept pivot </h3> 

                    <p> 

                        After the demo, I suggested that we pivot the concept of interaction. In the 
                        beginning, we were so focused on making it a first person point of view interaction. 
                        I noticed that the interaction are all going to be the same if we keep it that way. 
                        Thus, I suggested that all of the information pages have different interactions 
                        taking inspirations of data visualisations. This way, we present the users with
                        more attractive and engaging interactions. 
                    </p> 

                    <h3> Design Choices </h3>
                    
                    <p> As I mentioned before, the vision I have for the design of the application is modern design
                        with subtle color. The modern design attracts the users as it is a juxtaposition of 
                        information that is being presented. Apart from the background, I also wants to bring 
                        modern design of the objects that the users can interact with. 
                    </p>

                    <figure class="back-cont"> 
                        <image src="/image/des-1.png" alt="Main Collage"> </image>
                    </figure>

                    <p> Above is the main collage of the application that I created for the application. I 
                        knew from the beginning that I wanted to create the main background as a collage.
                        The reason behind this is because a collage can show multiple textures, colors and 
                        is busy thus attracts the users. To create the collage, I took inspirations and put
                        all of them together on my <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/tsamaranadira/collage/"> 
                        Pinterest Board</a>. I utilizes Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustration to edit 
                        and create the collage. I cropped the images used in Photoshop and collate all of them 
                        together on Adobe Illustrator. I make use of the layer window feature to show a certain
                        part of the image and hide others. To create more texture and incorporated the color scheme, 
                        I used the paintbrush tool, the pencil tool and the shape tool. Creating this design 
                        have helped me explore more tools to use and organizing the layers to emphasize on what 
                        I want to show. 
                    </p> 

                    <figure class="three-cont"> 
                        <image src="image/des-2.png" alt="page 1 Interaction 1">  </image>
                        <image src="image/des-3.png" alt="Prompt Interaction 1"> </image>
                        <image src="image/des-4.png" alt="Bakcground Interaction 2"> </image>
                    </figure>

                    <p> To show the modern designs I employ different sizes of lines and patterns. The first two pictures
                        from the right are the designs for interaction 1. For interaction 1, I highlighted the icons by the 
                        blue circle where the icons are placed. While the memphis patterns around it are to decorate and tie
                        the designs together. This have a modern feel to it as it is simple but still engaging and aesthetic. 
                        While for the background design of interaction 2, I used the pencil tool with 2pt size
                        to create waves accross the page diagonally. The color combination of white and blue fits together 
                        as they bring out each other. Making these background helped me progress in my design goals by 
                        exploring color combinations and patterns to make it more attractive. 
                    </p>

                    </figure>

                    <p> I highlighted the modern designs on the icons that are used throughout the application too. 
                        I decided to use line drawings for the icons as they are simplistic but also graceful. The designs
                        of the city icons take a lot more time to do and perfect. I learnt how to do it through a SkillShare
                        course on Building Line Drawings. The course taught me what to prioritize when doing line illustration
                        for buildings such as not incorporating as many details on it. While the two illustrations from the left 
                        are easier to do. 
                    </p>

                    <h3> Interaction Evolution </h3>

                    <p> I was originally in charge of just doing interaction 1 but one member of my team was uncapable
                        of finishing interaction 2. Thus, I took over interaction 2 and there were a lot of changes made 
                        to finalize both. 
                    </p>

                    <figure class="two-cont"> 
                        <image src="image/int-1.png"> </image>
                        <image src="image/int-2.png"></image>
                    </figure>

                    <p> I took the inspiration of interaction 1 from <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/45322159/Planet-Earth"> Planet Earth</a>. 
                        The main concept I took inspiration from is utlizing lines and the circle decorations 
                        to emphasizes the information. I improve on the idea by presenting the information 
                        as a pop-up. Presenting it as a pop-up is the main interaction for the users.
                        Creating this interaction is tough as there were a lot of challenges and changes 
                        that have to be made. 

                        <br> 
                        The first challenge is initially I wanted all four icons on one page however, as I 
                        begin coding the page it is clear that not all information can be kept on one page. 
                        Thus, I change the design and turn it into a two page interaction pages as seen on 
                        the pictures above. 
                        <br> 
                        The second challenge occured while coding the page because the icons won't 
                        stay where I wanted it to. I asked my tutors and Matt on how to resolve this and 
                        eventually fixed it. 

                        <br> 
                        <br> 


                    </p>

                    <figure class="two-cont"> 
                        <image src="image/int-3.png"></image>
                        <image src="image/int-4.png"></image>
                    </figure>

                    <p> I did not have much time to complete interaction 2 as the job was handed 
                        to me the week before the assignment is due. In the beginning, I had an idea
                        of having minimal interaction as seen on the picture on the right. The idea 
                        is that the users have to go through each option one by one by clicking on 
                        the next options on the bottom of the page. However, I was not happy with it
                        as it is such minimal interaction and it would not be as engaging. Thus, 
                        I created a different interaction shown in the picture on the right. The 
                        interaction now is a card-flipping action that the user have to tap 
                        on the picture and the information will be given. 

                        <br> 
                        Apart from having limited time to finish this page, I also stumbled upon 
                        other challenges. One of them is adapting the card flipping on each
                        of the options. I asked for help from my other group mate on the JavaScript
                        function of it as it took me a long time to do it. Even then, I could not 
                        finish fixing the JavaScript so that it would flip personally to each card 
                        rather than calling it. 
                    </p> 

                    <p> 
                        <br> 
                        Creating, designing and coding these interaction pages have improve my skills 
                        on designing line illustrations, exploring other CSS options and JavaScript. 
                    </p>

                    <h3> Trade Show  </h3>

                    <figure class="two-cont"> 
                        <image src="image/ts-1.jpg"></image>
                        <image src="image/ts-2.jpg"></image>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        To prepare for the trade show, I created the GUILT poster placed on the 
                        whiteboard behind us. The team have discussed before that the trade show 
                        will employ black theme. Black theme helps emphasize the information presented
                        and provide a clean cut look to the booth. I use the main collage as the part
                        of the poster added other pictures and textures around it. 

                        <br> 
                        <br> 
                        The pitch during the trade show is one of the biggest element that I have to prepare
                        for. I was incharge with the design portion of the pitch and discussed about my decisions
                        on the designs and why they are chosen. Building up from the demo pitch, I prepare 
                        myself to deliver a concise and full-pack information on the pitch as I was doing it with
                        my teammates on the limited time. 
                    </p> 

                    <h3> Reflection </h3>

                    <p> The final delivery really shows the collaboration of the team and how we communicate 
                        to one another. I am really happy with how the application and the trade show turns out. 
                        The main challenge that we have to face as a team was underestimating the time 
                        it takes to build and fix the interaction. However, we manage to put it all together 
                        and talk to one another when there are problems.

            <h2> Overall </h2>
            <p> My overall experience in DECO1800 is very motivating and a problem-solving 
                approach to the course itself. I struggled in the beginning of understanding
                the final project and what is expected of me. However, throughout the weeks,
                the discussion of the project helps me to build the final product. My main 
                concern in the beginning is working with a group and the miscommunication 
                that might happen. Gurantee, there were some struggles in coming together
                to one concept within the team but in the end the team pull it off. I 
                was frustrated in the week before the trade show as some of the team 
                member's approach to the project is different from what has been discussed 
                and other team members including me have to take in charge of it. In the end, 
                I am satisfied in what I have presented and contributed in the project. 
                I grow interms of skills in graphic designs, building more concise and thorough 
                codes and cooperation skills.

                        <h3> Early Prototype  </h3>

                        <p> Based on what I know of this course, I expect to be doing a group 
                            project that requires us to create an interactive platform and a 
                            report. I understand it as DECO1400 but doing it as a group and 
                            creating a DECO1100 report at the same time. 
                            <br> 
                            <br> 
                            Through DECO1800 I want to learn about: 

                            <ul> 
                                <li> Implementing my skills on HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a completely different topic from my previous projects. </li>
                                <li> Coding in a group and how I can contribute my skills towards the group. </li>
                                <li> Improve my communication skills to avoid any miscommunication issues with my teammates. </li>
                                <li> Manage my time wisely and putting maximum effort on all assignments. </li>

                            </ul>



                            <p> The brainstorming activities on Week 2 helped me thoroughly on understanding the data on SLQ 
                            better and the ways these data can be presented interactively. Using SCAMPER 
                            method shows me that there are so many ways to modify the idea and that changes are required to enhance the idea. 
                            Through the brainstorming activities, I notice that I need to dig deeper on my idea to make it unique and apart from that, 
                            I need to always remember the problem that I am trying to solve. I knew I wanted to use the Overseas 
                            Travel data but at this point, I struggled with coming up with an interactive concept. 
                            </p>


                            <p> Pitching my concept in front of the class is as nerve-wracking as it could be. Although I think
                            I did well, I notice a couple things that could be improved such as: </p>

                            <ul> 
                                <li> Mentioning the target audience, why they would be interested in the concept is important. </li>
                                <li> Mentioning where the installation is going to be in the museum and how it contributes to the museum. </li> 
                                <li> Communication skills by creating a more concise and informational pitch. </li> 
                                <li> Utilizing body movements and eye contact to engage the audiences to the pitch. </li>

                            </ul>
                            

                           <p> Based on seeing other students’ concepts and pitch I would rate 6/10 because other contains 
                            these aspects that mine does not: </p>

                            <ul> 
                                <li> Interact with the museum and users better  and hence creating a more engaging concept. </li>
                                <li> Using more interactive aspect such as sliders, zoom in and QR code to enhance the experience. </li>
                                <li> How the installation is implemented in the museum. </li>
                                <li> Mentioning specific age group that would be interested in the concept and how they experience it in their daily lives. </li>

                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p> The team consists of Naraen, Nichola, Russel and me. 

                            Naraen, Nichola and I have worked together in DECO1100 and we are comfortable with 
                            working together. I see a lot of benefits in being in a group with them as we communicated 
                            well in the past and we knew each other’s strengths and weaknesses. Learning from the past, 
                            I knew that our struggle may be underestimating the time we have to completing the project
                            aligning with our vision. However, if we attempt to make internal deadlines we should 
                            know where each of us are and how to solve the problem if there is any. Furthermore, I know that 
                            I can rely on my teammates and they will help me if I stumbled upon any problem. 
                            <br> 

                            Our means of communication: 
                            <ul> 
                                    <li> Facebook Messenger - first approach and room for each member to speak up if they have any problems. </li>
                                    <li> Google drive - Collaborate on report and share high quality design background, icons and other resources. </li>
                                    <li> Padlet - Platform for notes, discussions, feedback from tutors and feedback from other teams during contact sessions. </li>

                            started my research for DECO1400, I have grown interest in graphic design and started to pay attention more on 
                            the designs of websites and applications. I liked to explore more of graphic design and how it accommodates
                            user’s needs and is remarkable. </p>

                        <h3> Final Delivery </h3>

                        <p> Approaching the trade show, I started to reflect back to the pitches 
                            that I've done throughout the course of the subject. The biggest area 
                            of improvement for me is confidence and body language. I think doing 
                            it as a group takes off a lot of the pressure for me and it also
                            helps that I will be talking about the part that I have done with 
                            the project. 

                            <br> 
                            <br> 

                            I plan to practice my part of the pitch the weekend before the trade show 
                            so that by the trade show I know how to improvise it without losing 
                            any of the important information. Giving myself time to get comfortable with
                            the pitch will help me to present it naturally. The team also planned to 
                            meet up before the trade show to rehearse the pitch together. 
                        </p>

                        <p> Following the weeks after works-in-progress is submitted, the team 
                            has achieved one concept to approach. We made internal deadlines 
                            for each of the member to make sure that we completed in time and 
                            to our satisfaction. The first deadline is for each of the designers 
                            to complete their own ideation process and in the middle of to coding the html, css
                            and js files. The first deadline is on Week 11 as we imagine it would be 
                            finished by the end of the week. I finished my designs during week 9 and 
                            finished designing and coding the introduction pages and the quiz pages. 
                            The challenge that I faced during the first deadline was to get the 
                            objects on interaction 1 to stay fixed thoroughly. I discussed the problem
                            with the team during our meeting and discussed how the flow of the application
                            run considering the designs.The problem still holds until week 12 in which I decided to ask for help 
                            from tutors and Matt. 

                            <br> 
                            <br> 

                            Our second internalized deadline was at the end of week 11 in which we discussed 
                            our developments and any problem that we faced. Seeing that I did not have any problems, 
                            I used the time to finalise the color scheme, fonts and some changes I have made 
                            to the interaction. The following Tuesday, one team member spoke up about their struggle 
                            and suggested that I take over their part. I did not take the job lightly as I 
                            was under a lot of pressure finishing of my interaction while having to create 
                            another interaction. 

                            <br> 
                            <br> 

                            I managed to finished the interaction not to my satisfaction the next day which
                            then I decided to ideate and create another one. The second idea I had was
                            what we ended up doing which is a card-flipping interaction. However, due to 
                            limited time I had to complete it I could not complete the JavaScript to 
                            fully enhance the interaction. Taking over another team member's page
                            was difficult for me to do because I trusted all of them to complete their 
                            part. 

                            <br> 
                            <br> 

                            Our last internal deadline was the Friday of week 12 where we gather and discussed
                            the final touches of our application. During the meeting, I was still in the process
                            of finishing the second interaction and discussing the JavaScript problem I had. 
                            Another team member who excel more at the back-end helped me through most of 
                            the problem. 
                        </p>

                        <p> The trade show went as smoothly as we could hope for. Considering I had 
                            a lot on my plate the week before the trade show, my team mates have 
                            discussed that I will not do a lot of the preparation for the trade show. 
                            I ended up making the poster and preparing the decorations for the trade 
                            show. 

                            <br> 
                            <br> 
                            I would say that the involvement in trade show is equally distributed
                            as we all know what we were doing in terms of the pitch. The pitch 
                            itself was successful and I was satisfied with my involvement. The team
                            made a good effort to present the product of our application professionally
                            in terms of the booth decorations, Instructions and dressing in uniformity. 
                            For future studios, I would like to put more effort in the decoration 
                            by covering all the white board space and have rewards for visitors. In terms 
                            of professionality, I think my contribution is enough as we all dressed 
                            professionally and in uniform. I suggested an idea of having a space
                            for the users to put their matches on and create a discussion board. However, 
                            it was not delivered as expected.

                            <li> Learning different approach to designs. </li>
                            <li> Create a concise and thorough css code. </li>
                            <li> Communication skills by communicating with the team and tutors.</li>
                            <li> Problem solving skills.</li>
                            <li> Patience. <li>

                        <p> As I mentioned before, I think the course have guided me to complete 
                            the assignments overall. However, there are some suggestions that I 
                            think would help future students.

                        <ul> 
                            <li> Too much time spent before the Early Prototype such as 2 contact 
                                sessions for ideation. The time could have been used for feedback 
                                on the prototype or forming the group. 
                            </li>

                            <li> The last few weeks of workshops should not be accounted for 
                                attendance. Especially if we did not have any questions. 
                            </li>

                            <li> Discussing about how important the trade show is and the
                                display on Week 9 would have been helpful for us to prepare 
                                for the trade show. 
                            </li>

                            <li> Providing a peer assessment throughout work in progress and 
                                final delivery to take into account the people who did more 
                                of the project. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
